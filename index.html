			<p>Hi! My name is Allen and I am an aspiring web developer. I am a UCSD graduate student, with a B.S. in General Biology. 
				I decided to attend the Coding Boot Camp at UC Berekely extension, because I believe, despite my bio background, that
				my true strength has always been in a subject that requires logic problem solving and good organizational skills. For 6
				months, I have learned about all aspects of coding, and honed my skills through working
				more than a dozen solo and team projects some of which are shown here in the portfolio section. I have now graduated, and  
				I am continuing to go over and improve those same projects I have worked on to increase my knowledge of this subject.
				Through my skills, I am also working on my own forum style website which I hope to get live soon. 
				I am a hard worker with a love for coding I believe I could be a great contribution to your company or project! 
				Please check out my github and send me an message through email or linkedin! I hope to get connected with you!
